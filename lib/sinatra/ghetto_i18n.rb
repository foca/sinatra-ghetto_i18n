module Sinatra
  # Extension that provides simplified I18N for your Sinatra applications.
  #
  # When you register this extension you gain access to 3 application settings,
  # a couple of useful methods, and new options when definining routes and
  # rendering views.
  #
  # The idea behind this is that all the routes in your application are
  # namespaced by the language you want to use.
  #
  # So for example, if you want to provide the "/events" URL in english,
  # spanish, and portuguese, using this extension you would have:
  #
  #   GET /en/events
  #   GET /es/events
  #   GET /pt/events
  #
  # Then, when you render a view (by passing a symbol to erb etc), the view is
  # automatically looked up in a way that will include the language.
  #
  # This assumes you want a separate view file for each language. This means
  # more work maintaining the site, yes, but for very simple websites this is
  # often easier than keeping a translations file.
  #
  # This also helps when you have two widely different languages in which the
  # design is affected by the translation (for example, an LTR and a RTL
  # language.)
  #
  # = Options =
  #
  # When using this extension, you have access to the following settings:
  #
  # == +:languages+ ==
  #
  # You *must* set this to an enumerable that has the language codes your
  # application supports. Any object that responds to #include? and #each works.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #     set :languages, ["en", "es", "pt"]
  #     set :languages, "en" => "English", "es" => "EspaÃ±ol"
  #
  # (The rationale for this is that you might want to use a hash for setting
  # names in order to build links to switch languages, but you can just pass an
  # array if you don't need that)
  #
  # == +:default_language+ ==
  #
  # A string with the 2-letter language code of the default language for your
  # application. Defaults to English.
  #
  # == +:i18n_view_format: ==
  #
  # The path to the internationalized view files. This should be a block that
  # takes two arguments (the original view file, and the language) and must
  # return a symbol.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #     set :i18n_view_format do |view, lang|
  #       :"#{lang}_#{view}"
  #     end
  #
  # That means when you render the ":some_view" view, you are actually rendering
  # the ":en_some_view" if the user is browsing the English site, or the
  # ":fr_some_view" file if the user is browsing the French site.
  #
  # The default is +lang/view+, so your typical sinatra application will look
  # like this (in case the languages you support are English and Spanish ("en"
  # and "es"):
  #
  #     .
  #     |- website.rb
  #     \- views
  #        |- en
  #        |  |- view_a.erb
  #        |  \- view_b.erb
  #        \- es
  #           |- view_a.erb
  #           \- view_b.erb
