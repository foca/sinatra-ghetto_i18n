This is the simplest, hackiest way to add translations to your Sinatra

== How do I use it?

The code is (or should be) fairly well documented. Read it :)

If you want a live demo, we use it at http://rubyconfuruguay.org

And that's open source, so you can see its code[http://github.com/foca/rubyconfuruguay-website].
